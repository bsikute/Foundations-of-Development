# Reference Guide - GIT, Docker, PowerShell and Bash
The following is a reference guide that demonstrates some commands used to work with GIT, Docker, PowerShell and Bash

# GIT
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

   ### Configure tooling
   Configure user information for all local repositories

    // Sets the name you want attached to your commit transactions
    $ git config --global user.name "[name]"
    
    // Sets the email you want attached to your commit transactions
    $ git config --global user.email "[email address]"
    
   ### Create repositories
   When starting out with a new repository, you only need to do it once; either locally,  
   then push to GitHub, or by cloning an existing repository
   
    // Sets the
    Clone (download) a repository that already exists on GitHub, including all of the files, branches, and commits
    $ git clone [url]
    
   ### Branching
   Branches are an important part of working with Git. Any commits you make will be made on the branch 
   you're currently “checked out” to. Use git status to see which branch that is.
   
    $ git branch [branch-name]
    Creates a new branch
